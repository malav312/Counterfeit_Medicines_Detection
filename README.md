# Counterfeit_Medicines_Detection
Using SOTA techniques to identify fake medicines in the healthcare industry
This is the final version of Identifying Counterfeit Medicines using cross-analysis of features. The following are the outcomes of the project.
* Counterfeit recognizing system: The approach developed out of this project is capable of detecting and analyzing counterfeit products. Unlike most machine
learning models, this approach is computationally efficient and highly scalable, making it a promising solution for large-scale applications.
* Nascent Approach: The milestones achieved in this project have led to the development of a new approach that addresses the common problem of limited datasets in
machine learning projects. This novel cross-analysis methodology is computationally efficient and can be applied in situations where traditional machine-learning methods
fall short.
* Dataset: While the obtained dataset has some limitations, it is currently the only one of its kind in India, highlighting a need for more similar datasets to increase
public awareness and support further research in this area.
* Data Analysis Methodology: The project was able to create a robust and user-friendly function that can be easily replicated to conduct in-depth image analysis. This
function will provide a comprehensive set of information and enable researchers to gain deeper insights into their data.
